####Who am I?
A driven and fast learning, team player who loves technology. 

After graduating in Air Transport Operations in 2007, I have spent time in various roles in the travel industry encompassing buying, selling and negotiating contracts with hotels. Most recently I was tasked with growing and automating the group reservations department for a large student accommodation provider in London and Brighton. 

While working on projects I was lacking a key skill to develop and understand the online presence our company needed. I decided to join [Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com) to learn to code the "right way". 


####Experience

####[Makers Academy](https://www.makersacademy.com)
#####Web Development Teacher - Consultancy (October 2014 - present)
After graduating at Makers, I am now working there on a temporary basis as a teaching consultant and supporting the current batch of students with their work and being on hand to answer any technical questions they have. 

I am also supporting the Makers Engineering Team by testing some of their software and working with their Director of Engineering to provide mentorship support and feedback on pre-course materials for future students already booked onto the course. 

#####Web Development Student (June - September 2014)
Final Project: [Challenge Me](https://github.com/nikeshashar/challenge-me) - a group project designed to make fund raising fun. Using TDD and Rails, we worked to plug a hole in the fundraising industry and made people accountable for their fundraising. 

My responsibilities on the team were to create and work on the back-end of the app and ensure all of our code was tested and working. I paired with [Toan](https://www.github.com/yoshdog) mainly for the creation of the database and it's various dependancies. Once the MVP was up we used two API's (JustGiving and MapMyFitness) to create a full user experience. 

####[Escape the City](https://www.escapethecity.org)
I started volunteering my time to Esc to help run their evening meetups and events over 2 years ago. Most recently, I am involved with 99 other people on a pioneering program to help shape the future of the [Escape School](https://school.escapethecity.org/).
